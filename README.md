# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions

Here lies my attempts at solving the daily code challenges in AoC using the Rust programming language. I haven't touched low-level languages since college, so any feedback would be appreciated. Otherwise feel free to use it as a reference for your own solutions.

### Installation

If you use [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/), you can run `asdf install` at the root of the project after installing the asdf-rust plugin. Otherwise, install Rust with however your OS deems best. At the time of writing this, these projects were compiled with v1.65.0

* Install Rust
* `cd day1`, or whichever day's solution you'd like to run
* `cargo run -- "assets/input.txt"` unless otherwise specified for that day.
* You may also run the tests for that day via `cargo test`
